<p align="center">The use of online solutions has paved the way for the future of learning, making it easier than ever to get access to work and information.<br/>
 It is now easier than ever to get into contact with teachers during or after working hours. This is all thanks to the implementation of online solutions. Students are<br/>
 now able to work whenever and wherever they are. The students that will suffer the most at Grey will be the students that have learning setbacks, such as procrastination, <br/>
 learning disabilities, and students who are not skilled in self-directed learning. This is where the implementation of parents should come in. Parents are there to guide their<br/>
 children to achieve the best that they can. Working when they are supposed to is something that can be enforced by their parents, and the parents can keep in contact with the school <br/>
 by use of the mentioned online solutions. Without the use of online solutions, Grey would have definitely suffered during the initial lockdown, as there wouldnâ€™t be any way to<br/>
 get the work across as efficiently and effectively as online solutions have done.</p>
