<h2 align="center">Findings</h2>
	<p align="center"> I have found that online solutions are the best alternative to learning in lockdown. This is due to the fact that big service providers have <br/> 
made it a lot easier for students to access work, and the fact that accessing the work is easier than ever in general. If students have access to the internet <br/> 
and a smartphone at the very least, they will be able to access the school work, attend virtual classes, and send their work through to the teachers. It is also <br/> 
a great way for the teachers to get a hold of their studentsâ€™ parents in the lockdown, and further beyond that.
