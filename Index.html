For my PAT, I have been given the task to identify the changes and suggest ways in which the education sector can be improved.<br/>
I have outlined many of the online solutions for learning, andI believe that E-Learning is the future of education. Since the start <br/> 
of 2019, the education system and the way things are worked has been changed tremendously.Since the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic, <br/> 
there have been lots of draw backs that have come with the pandemic, and the biggest challenge that schools had to overcome was lockdown.<br/> 
In this investigation, I will be focusing on the education sector and on the positive and negative impacts and changes that covid-19 has had <br/> 
on the education sector.</P>
